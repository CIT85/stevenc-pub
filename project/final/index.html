        <h2>Why is self-sufficiency important?</h2>
        <p>
        Being self-sufficient is important for several reasons, both on an individual and societal level.
        </p>
        <br>

        <div class="container_double">
        <section class="box">
            <h3>Freedom and Independence</h3>
            <p>Self-sufficiency provides individuals with a greater sense of <mark>freedom</mark> and <mark>independence</mark>. When you are able to meet your own needs 
                without relying heavily on others or external systems, you have more control over your life and decisions.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box">
            <h3>Environmental Sustainability</h3>
            <p>Self-sufficiency often involves practices that are more <mark>environmentally sustainable</mark>. For example, growing your own food reduces 
                reliance on industrial agriculture, which can be resource-intensive and environmentally damaging. Generating renewable energy 
                reduces reliance on fossil fuels and helps mitigate climate change.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box">
            <h3>Personal Growth and Empowerment</h3>
            <p>Engaging in self-sufficient activities such as gardening, cooking, or DIY projects can promote personal <mark>growth</mark> and <mark>empowerment</mark>. 
                Learning new skills, overcoming challenges, and seeing the tangible results of your efforts can boost confidence and self-esteem.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box">  
            <h3>Health and Well-being</h3>
            <p>Self-sufficiency can contribute to improved <mark>health</mark> and <mark>well-being</mark>. Growing your own food often leads to a diet that is fresher, healthier, 
                and more nutritious. Engaging in physical activities like gardening or woodworking can also promote physical and mental health.</p>
