        <h2>Energy Conservation</h2>
        <p>Conserving power at home has numerous benefits, impacting both individual households and the broader environment. 
          Some benefits include: cost savings on utility bills, environmental benefits, and energy security.  
        </p>
        <h3>Appliances</h3>
        <ul class="container_double">
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Use Energy-Efficient Appliances: </strong> <br>  Look for appliances with the Energy Star label, which indicates they meet 
              energy efficiency guidelines set by the EPA.
          </li>
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Optimize Refrigerator and Freezer Use: </strong> <br> Set your refrigerator to 37-40째F (3-4째C) and your freezer 
              to 0째F (-18째C) for optimal efficiency. Regularly check and replace door seals to ensure they are airtight.
          </li>
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Laundry Tips: </strong> <br> Run washing machines and dryers with full loads to maximize efficiency. Use cold water for 
              washing clothes whenever possible. Air dry clothes on a line or drying rack instead of using the dryer.
          </li>
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Heating and Cooling: </strong> <br> Use ceiling fans to circulate air and reduce the need for heating and cooling.
              Keep your HVAC systems well-maintained with regular filter changes and professional servicing.
          </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Habits</h3>
        <ul class="container_triple">
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Unplug Devices: </strong> <br>   Unplug chargers, electronics, and small appliances when not in use to avoid "phantom" energy usage.
          </li>
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Lighting: </strong> <br> Turn off lights when you are not in the room. Replace incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs, which use up 
              to 75% less energy and last much longer.
          </li>
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Appliance Use Habits: </strong> <br> Keep appliances clean and well-maintained to ensure they run efficiently.

        <h2>Solar Generation</h2>
        <p>Over the last several years, solar panels have increasingly got less expensive as the technology has advanced.  It is easy to get started with 
          small portable panels which you can purchase one at a time and connect to a small battery.  The first step is to conduct an energy audit of your 
          home to determine your current energy consumption. This can help you understand how much energy you need and identify ways to reduce usage.

        <h2>Wind Generation</h2>
        <p>Getting started with wind generation involves several steps, from assessing the suitability of your location to installing and maintaining your wind turbine.
          Determine the average wind speed in your area. Wind turbines typically require average wind speeds of at least 5-6 meters per second (11-13 miles per hour) 
          to be viable. You can use wind maps or data from meteorological stations. Determine the size of the wind turbine you need based on your energy consumption
           and average wind speeds. Turbines are rated by their capacity in kilowatts (kW). Hire a professional to conduct a detailed site assessment. This may include 
            measuring wind speeds over a period of time to ensure viability.

        <h2>Energy Storage</h2>
        <p>Home energy storage systems allow homeowners to store energy generated from renewable sources, like solar or wind power, or even from the grid during off-peak 
          times, for use when needed. Here are some examples of home energy storage systems:</p>
        <h3>Energy storage examples</h3>
        <ul class="container_triple">
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Tesla Powerwall: </strong> <br>  One of the most popular home energy storage solutions, Tesla's Powerwall is a lithium-ion battery that can 
              store energy from solar panels or the grid. It provides backup power during outages and can be stacked for additional capacity.
          <li class="box">
                <strong> Portable Power Systems: </strong> <br>  These are designed to provide a reliable source of power for various applications, from home backup 
                and off-grid living to outdoor adventures and professional use. Several companies such as EcoFlow and Bluetti offer multiple product which vary in price 
                and capacity based on your needs.
          </li>
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Deep Cycle Batteries: </strong> <br> Traditional lead-acid batteries, like those from Trojan or Rolls, are commonly used in off-grid solar systems. 
              While they are less expensive upfront, they generally have shorter lifespans and require more maintenance compared to lithium-ion batteries.
