        <h2>Create a budget</h2>
        Starting a budget is an essential step in managing your finances effectively and achieving your financial goals.

        <h2>Pay off debts</h2>
        <p>Paying off debt is important for several reasons, as it has a significant impact on your financial well-being and future prospects. 
          Some of the advantages are: reduced financial stress, giving you more financial freedom to pursue your goals and priorities, and
          long-term financial security.
        </p>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <ul class="container_double_only">
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Snowball Method: </strong> <br>  The snowball method focuses on paying off debts in order from smallest balance to largest 
              balance, regardless of interest rate. It provides quick wins by focusing on paying off smaller debts first, which can motivate individuals 
              to continue paying off debt. It's more about psychological momentum than financial optimization.
          </li>
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Avalanche Method: </strong> <br> The avalanche method prioritizes paying off debts with the highest interest rates first, 
              regardless of the balance. Saves the most money on interest over time by prioritizing high-interest debts. While it may take longer 
              to pay off the first debt compared to the snowball method, it results in overall savings on interest payments.

        <h2>Invest in your future</h2>
        <p>Starting to invest is an important step towards building wealth and achieving your financial goals. Familiarize yourself with basic 
          investment concepts, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), diversification, risk, and return.</p>
        <h3>Types of Retirement Funds</h3>
        <ul class="container_triple">
          <li class="box">
              <strong> 401k: </strong> <br>  A 401(k) is a type of employer-sponsored retirement savings plan offered by many companies to their 
              employees in the United States. It allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax income to a retirement account, where
               it can grow tax-deferred until withdrawal during retirement. 
          </li>
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Traditional IRA: </strong> <br> A Traditional IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is a type of retirement savings account 
              available to individuals in the United States that offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Individuals can contribute to a 
                Traditional IRA with pre-tax dollars, meaning contributions are tax-deductible in the year they are made.
          </li>
          <li class="box">
            <strong> Roth IRA: </strong> <br> Individuals can contribute to a Roth IRA with after-tax dollars, meaning contributions are not 
            tax-deductible in the year they are made.  While contributions to a Roth IRA are not tax-deductible, qualified withdrawals from a 
            Roth IRA are tax-free. This means that individuals can withdraw their contributions and earnings tax-free in retirement, provided 
            certain conditions are met.
        </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Investments</h3>
        <ul class="container_double">
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Stocks: </strong> <br>  Stocks represent ownership in a corporation. When you buy stock in a company, you become a 
              shareholder and own a portion of that company. Stocks tend to offer higher potential returns but also come with higher volatility 
              and risk. The value of a stock can fluctuate based on factors such as company performance, industry trends, and overall market conditions.
          </li>
          <li class="box">
              <strong> Bonds: </strong> <br> Bonds are debt instruments issued by governments, municipalities, or corporations to raise capital. 
              When you buy a bond, you are lending money to the issuer in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of the principal 
              amount at maturity.  Bonds provide a fixed stream of income through periodic interest payments, known as coupon payments. 
          </li>
          <li class="box">
            <strong> Mutual Funds: </strong> <br> Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, 
            bonds, or other securities. Each investor owns shares of the mutual fund, which represents a proportional interest in the fund's holdings.
            Mutual funds are managed by professional fund managers who make investment decisions on behalf of the investors. 
        </li>
        <li class="box">
          <strong> Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): </strong> <br>  ETFs are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks. 
          They are similar to mutual funds in that they hold a diversified portfolio of securities, but they differ in their structure and trading characteristics.
          ETFs offer liquidity and flexibility, as they can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices.
